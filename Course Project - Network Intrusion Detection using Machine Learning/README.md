## Course Project
In CSE422, we had to preprocess a dataset, run various machine learning algorithms with this dataset, and compare the results provided by each algorithm. Additionally, we had to be careful not to overfit the dataset, which could lead to incorrect prediction rates from the algorithms. This was essentially what we had to do in the CSE422 Project.

Here's the project - [NIDS Machine Learning](https://github.com/mahrjose/NIDS-Machine-Learning)
